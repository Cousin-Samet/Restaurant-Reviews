## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, you will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

## Credits

The Walkthrough by Mohamed Riaad was a great resource to learn more about the basics of the project, to revise ARIA roles and labels and to brush up my knowledge about accessibility auditioning.
